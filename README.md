# leaflet-challenge

These are the sources I used to help write my code: leafletjs.com, openstreetmap.org, google, and BCS â€” watching our cloud recordings, using instructor activity solutions and the class activities as references.

In this assignment, the task is to develop a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.

## Project Description

This project is part of an activity that is broken down into two parts:

- Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
- Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional with no extra points earning)

For this repository, only Part 1 has been completed. The code and documentation provided herein pertain solely to the implementation of the Earthquake Visualization.
